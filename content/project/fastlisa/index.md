summary: The main goal of FAST LISA is to develop a model for data collection, capacity building, and community engagement. It focuses on training ambassadors for online and offline awareness actions that identify and combat hate speech online. Furthermore, the effect of youth speech on AI-based algorithmic detection of hate speech is explored. For this purpose, a framework for identifying youth language biases in datasets is developed. The findings are incorporated into the development of domain-specific machine learning algorithms for classifying hate speech.
