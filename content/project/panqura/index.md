summary: Anyone seeking reliable information in times of crisis is confronted with a flood of information on the Internet and in social media. The targeted dissemination of false reports or fraudulent offers of help further complicates this situation. This challenge has been addressed by selected partners from the Qurator Alliance in the Panqura project. Using AI-based curation technologies, a technology platform was created for more information transparency in times of crisis - and beyond.
