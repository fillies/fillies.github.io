summary: As part of the research and development work, manual sub-processes of curation were automated with the help of AI technologies. These include, for example, searching and finding, viewing, selecting, ordering, sorting, summarizing, classifying, linking, or visualizing content and data. Further developed as curation technologies, they support the process of creating and maintaining content while at the same time creating an optimal basis for intelligent services such as semantic search, recommendation, or monitoring systems. The aim of the joint project was to develop a technology platform that supports a wide range of information sources, data formats and application scenarios. This modular platform is used to test and index.mdevaluate the newly developed processes.
