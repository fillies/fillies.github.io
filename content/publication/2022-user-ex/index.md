abstract: "The increasingly rapid spread of information about COVID-19 on the web calls for automatic measures of credibility assessment. If large parts of the population are expected to act responsibly during a pandemic, they need information that can be trusted. In that context, we model the credibility of texts using 25 linguistic phenomena, such as spelling, sentiment and lexical diversity. We integrate these measures in a graphical interface and present two empirical studies to evaluate its usability for credibility assessment on COVID-19 news. Raw data for the studies, including all questions and responses, has been made available to the public using an open license: https://github.com/konstantinschulz/credible-covid-ux. The user interface prominently features three sub-scores and an aggregation for a quick overview. Besides, metadata about the concept, authorship and infrastructure of the underlying algorithm is provided explicitly."
