**About me**
I am a computer science PhD candidate at [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/) and scientific researcher at [INFAI](https://infai.org/) researching the influence of youth language on algorithmic hate speech detection. During this process, I am collecting data, developing prototypes for educational outreach in schools, and training multilingual detection models. As part of the project, I am working on developing a bias detection framework and training machine learning models tailored to this context. I am using symbolic AI methods to combine the sparsely available datasets and enhance the range of definitions of hate covered by the trained networks.

**Interests**
* Natural Language Processing 
* Symbolic, Subsymbolic AI, and everything in between 
* Algorithmic Hate Speech Detection
* Definitions of Hate
* Online Youth Language
