Recent studies have concentrated on automated supervised detection of hate speech. However, there remains limited understanding of an effective strategy for identifying multilingual hate speech in social media posts. This study introduces an innovate experimental design for multilingual hate speech detection. It compares different approaches to automatically detect multilingual hate speech through a series of experiments and creates a classification algorithm for hate speech in German, Italian and Spanish text-based social media content. The study creates monolingual, multilingual, and translated datasets specific to the language triplet. Subsequently, the research explores suitable models for multilingual hate speech detection, evaluating a total of seven transformer-based models along with corresponding SVM models on the constructed datasets. The findings indicate that all chosen transformer-based models outperform the baseline SVM models. The research highlights the superiority of a multilingual approach, utilizing XLM-RoBERTa as a classifier model, over monolingual, multilingual, and translation-based approaches. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that translation-based methods in connection to the model DistillBERT can serve as viable alternatives to the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa approach, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are restricted and processing speed is of importance.","tags":null,"title":"Multilingual Hate Speech Detection: Comparison of Transfer Learning Methods to Classify German, Italian, and Spanish Posts","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701961200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701961200,"objectID":"a8edef490afe42206247b6ac05657af0","permalink":"https://fillies.github.io/talk/metalab-at-fu-berlin-digital-mapping-of-contemporaneity-activism-ecology.html","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/metalab-at-fu-berlin-digital-mapping-of-contemporaneity-activism-ecology.html","section":"event","summary":"Advancing Hate Speech Detection in Online Communication of Adolescents.

Adolescents are highly active social media users and the majority of them experience or witness online hate speech. Therefore, educators are facing the challenge of how to handle the topic in an engaging and modern way. In prior work it has been shown that the understanding of hate speech varies depending on time, language, and topic. Another challenge is the small number of available data sets. This research addresses the problem of obtaining information to understand hate speech from the perspective of adolescents. Due to the difficulties of working with adolescents (e.g. data protection), it is challenging to create data sets for this specific subgroup. This research closes the gap by presenting a gamified annotation tool to be used in educational workshops within schools. Students are enabled to perform hate speech annotations in a controlled gamified environment. The gamified solution supplies schools with a live and realistic setting for a modern and motivational way to interact with the topic. This research demonstrates how to use the setting of educating students on the topic of hate speech in a safe space while understanding their perspective on hate speech.","tags":null,"title":"Student’s View on Hate Speech: Gamified Annotation for Educational Use","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Jan Fillies**","Silvio Peikert","Adrian Paschke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1679529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679529600,"objectID":"422dfe84307c5a198f02d7ebbe4fba2c","permalink":"https://fillies.github.io/publication/2023-students-view-on-hate.html","publishdate":"2023-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-students-view-on-hate.html","section":"publication","summary":"With the rise of social media, a rise of hateful content can be observed. Even though the understanding and definitions of hate speech varies, platforms, communities, and legislature all acknowledge the problem. Therefore, adolescents are a new and active group of social media users. The majority of adolescents experience or witness online hate speech. Research in the field of automated hate speech classification has been on the rise and focuses on aspects such as bias, generalizability, and performance. To increase generalizability and performance, it is important to understand biases within the data. This research addresses the bias of youth language within hate speech classification and contributes by providing a modern and anonymized hate speech youth language data set consisting of 88.395 annotated chat messages. The data set consists of publicly available online messages from the chat platform Discord. ~6,42% of the messages were classified by a self-developed annotation schema as hate speech. For 35.553 messages, the user profiles provided age annotations setting the average author age to under 20 years old.","tags":null,"title":"Hateful Messages: A Conversational Data Set of Hate Speech produced by Adolescents on Discord","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Tests\n","date":1674172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674172800,"objectID":"60e79cb28829481c20d3db0f4695ad7c","permalink":"https://fillies.github.io/blog/about-me.html","publishdate":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me.html","section":"blog","summary":"Details.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Konstantin Schulz","Jens Rauenbusch","**Jan Fillies**","Lisa Rutenburg","Dimitrios Karvelas","Georg Rehm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655942400,"objectID":"19c478932ce3083e884cbd02e60f693e","permalink":"https://fillies.github.io/publication/2022-user-ex.html","publishdate":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-user-ex.html","section":"publication","summary":"The increasingly rapid spread of information about COVID-19 on the web calls for automatic measures of credibility assessment. If large parts of the population are expected to act responsibly during a pandemic, they need information that can be trusted. In that context, we model the credibility of texts using 25 linguistic phenomena, such as spelling, sentiment and lexical diversity. We integrate these measures in a graphical interface and present two empirical studies to evaluate its usability for credibility assessment on COVID-19 news. Raw data for the studies, including all questions and responses, has been made available to the public using an open license: https://github.com/konstantinschulz/credible-covid-ux.
